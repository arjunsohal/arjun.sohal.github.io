    <h1>Make a Tax Calculating Calculator On Scratch in Just Four Steps</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Step 1</h2>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arjunsohal/arjunsohal.github.io/master/Capture.PNG" width="1310">
    <p>Open up scratch and create a new project</p>
    <h2>Step 2</h2>
        <img src="https://github.com/arjunsohal/arjunsohal.github.io/blob/master/Capture%206.PNG?raw=true" width="1310" height="650">
    <p>Add five variables and name them PST, GST, Total tax, Item cost, and Total cost</p>
    <h2>Step 3</h2>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arjunsohal/arjunsohal.github.io/master/Capture%203.PNG" width="1310" height="700">
    <p>Use the ask and wait block and ask the questions "What is the PST in your province/state?", "What is the GST in your country?", and "How much does your item cost?". Use the answers to those questions to set the PST, GST, and item cost. To get total tax
    use the adding block in operators and add the PST and GST. And finally to get total cost you need to do add blocks that divide the total tax by 100 then that gets multiplied by the items cost and then the items cost gets added again. Once all the questions are answered the total cost (cost after tax) should appear on the top left corner.</p>
    <h2>Step 4</h2>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arjunsohal/arjunsohal.github.io/master/Capture%204.PNG" width="1310">
    <p>Once all of the blocks have been added in title, save, and share your project</p>
