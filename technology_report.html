    <h2>My Opinion on its Success</h2>
    <p>I think the Samsung Galaxy S9 will have lots of success because samsung, the company making the phone is well known and a lot of the previous their previous phones sold very well. Although I do think this phone will have successful sales I do not think it will outsell some of the previous models like the Samsng Galaxy S8 because the phone is expensive and the differences between newer and some of the older models aren't too major.</p>
